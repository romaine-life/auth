# Backup destination for the auth-db CNPG Cluster. CloudNativePG's
# barmanObjectStore handles continuous WAL archiving and periodic base
# backups; the destination here is a dedicated Azure Storage Account
# scoped to one container so a compromised credential can't reach any
# other workload's data.
#
# Auth model: workload identity. CNPG pods authenticate to Storage via
# the `auth-db-backup-writer` UAMI (provisioned in workload-identity.tf)
# bound to the auth-db ServiceAccount via federated credential. The
# UAMI holds Storage Blob Data Contributor at CONTAINER scope only.

# Storage account name must be globally unique, lowercase alphanumeric,
# 3-24 chars. random_string suffix keeps it deterministic per state
# file while avoiding collisions across environments.
